You are working on the optimization problem: "{problem}"

Your working directory is: {run_dir}

This directory already contains:
- heuristics/ (empty, for you to save heuristics)
- evaluation/ (empty, where evaluation results will be saved)

Get started by:
1. Using get_problem.py to understand the problem
2. Creating a simple baseline heuristic
3. Iterating to improve it

Remember to use descriptive names for your heuristics (e.g., 01_greedy_baseline.py, 02_priority_scoring.py, etc.).
